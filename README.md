How to Play:
  Choose or create a username
  Select your preferred game settings (word length and number of guesses).
  Enter your guesses. After each guess, you'll receive feedback:
  green (C): Correct letter in the correct position.
  Yellow (c): Correct letter in the wrong position.
  Dash (-): Letter not present in the secret word.

Additional Info about how the game decides what is C (yellow)/ c (green).
  When you enter a word in Wordle, each letter is checked against the correct word. If a letter is in the correct position, it turns green. If a letter exists in the correct word but is in the wrong position, it turns yellow. However, if the correct word only contains that letter once, and you guess it multiple times in different positions, only one of them will turn yellow â€” the rest will remain gray. This is because the game only gives credit for the exact number of times a letter appears in the correct word.
